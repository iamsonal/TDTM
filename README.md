# TDTM
Table-Driven Trigger Management (TDTM)

Overview: https://powerofus.force.com/s/article/EDA-TDTM-Overview

I have extracted all the TDTM related files from EDA package, removed all EDA dependencies, thereby stripping off unnecessary code, to make it a portable package.

Simply deploy all the files in your Salesforce org, and start using this trigger framework. No other dependency required.

Example: Take a look of how CON_UpdateContact_TEST has been written.
